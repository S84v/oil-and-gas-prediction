# Crude Oil Production Analysis üõ¢Ô∏è

## Introduction

Crude oil production is a critical component of the global energy market and has significant implications for economies and industries worldwide. This project aims to analyze crude oil production data to uncover trends, patterns, and insights that can inform decision-making in the energy sector.

### Objectives üéØ
- **Data Collection**: Gather historical crude oil production data from reliable sources.
- **Data Cleaning**: Process the data to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Use statistical methods and visualizations to explore the data.
- **Trend Analysis**: Identify and analyze long-term trends in crude oil production.
- **Predictive Modeling**: Build models to forecast future production levels.

### Dataset üìä
The dataset used in this project includes:
- Historical crude oil production data of Volve field.

### Tools and Technologies üõ†Ô∏è
- **Python**: Programming language used for data analysis and modeling.
- **Pandas**: Library for data manipulation and analysis.
- **Plotly.JS**: Libraries for data visualization.
- **Scikit-learn**: Machine learning library for predictive modeling.

### Structure of the Notebook üìñ
1. **Data Collection and Cleaning**: Steps to gather and preprocess the data.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Visualizations and statistical analysis of the data.
3. **Trend Analysis**: Examination of production trends over time.
4. **Predictive Modeling**: Development and evaluation of predictive models.
5. **Conclusions and Insights**: Key findings and their implications for the industry.

By the end of this project, we aim to provide a comprehensive analysis of crude oil production trends and deliver actionable insights that can help stakeholders in making informed decisions.
